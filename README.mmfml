This is my amazingâ„¢ standard library.

See the header files for documentation.

= Notes =

1. all functions are namespaced, such as `hashmap_new()`, `string_new()`, `llist_append()` etc...
2.
    `*_new2()` allocates the struct itself on the heap while
    `*_new()` asks for a pointer to a caller-defined value which can be
    stack or heap allocated
    a.
        `*_new2()` must be deleted with `*_del2()`
        and `*_new()` must be deleted with `*_del()`

3. functions should generally work the same no matter what (dont break userspace)
4. struct properties may change, break, etc... do not rely on them
